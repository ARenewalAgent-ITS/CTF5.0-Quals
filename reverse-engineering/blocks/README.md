```


## Description

[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) is modernized of the prior product which MIT has made, so I'll go for the older **inventions**. Here's an app that holds a free & calculated `(long *)FLAG` for you ⛳!

Flag Format: `ARA5{.*}`

## Difficulty
baby/easy

## Hints

## Tags
`aia`, `blockly-lang`

## Notes

## Solver

- This is an `.aia` file , which is a project file from [MIT Inventor App](https://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/) using a [Blockly Language](https://developers.google.com/blockly)
- Open it in there and check that there are 2 workspaces, that the other space is a `Flag Checker` space
- The flag is validated as a LONG integer type judging from the UI screen. 
- To get the blockly logics, simply tap the "Blocks" button at the right corner, it's only a simple XOR.
- XOR the hardcoded value to get the flag and profit
