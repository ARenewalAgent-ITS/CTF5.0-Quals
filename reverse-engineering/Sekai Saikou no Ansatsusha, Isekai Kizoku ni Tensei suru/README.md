Flag Format: `ARA5{.*}`

## Difficulty
baby/easy

## Hints

`C++`, `XOR`

## Notes

## Solver
- Given `LughTuathaDe.exe`, it asks for an input through the cmdline.
- reversing statically will reveal a validation function.
- it will check if our input starts with `ARA5{` and has the length of 25 which corresponds to the flag.
- it will then the string inside of `{.*}` and simply **xor** it known fixed key exist within the executable.
